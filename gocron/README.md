[![GitHub go.mod Go version of a Go module](https://img.shields.io/github/go-mod/go-version/gomods/athens.svg)](https://github.com/flohoss/gocron)

A task scheduler built with Go and Vue.js that allows users to specify recurring jobs via a simple YAML configuration file. The scheduler reads job definitions, executes commands at specified times using cron expressions, and passes in environment variables for each job.

## Features

- Simple Configuration: Easily define jobs, cron schedules, and environment variables in a YAML config file.
- Cron Scheduling: Supports cron expressions for precise scheduling.
- Environment Variables: Define environment variables specific to each job.
- Easy Job Management: Add and remove jobs quickly with simple configuration.
- Pre-installed backup-software for an easy backup solution

## How It Works

- Defaults Section: This section defines default values that are applied to all jobs. You can specify a default cron expression and environment variables to be inherited by each job.
- Jobs Section: Here, you define multiple jobs. Each job can have its own cron expression, environment variables, and commands to execute.
- Environment Variables: Define environment variables for each job to customize its runtime environment.
- Commands: Each job can have multiple commands, which will be executed in sequence.

## Docker

### run command

```sh
docker run -it --rm \
  --name gocron \
  --hostname gocron \
  -p 8156:8156 \
  -e TZ=Europe/Berlin \
  # Delete runs from db after x days, disable with -1
  -e DELETE_RUNS_AFTER_DAYS=7 \
  -e SEND_ON_SUCCESS=true \
  # Log level can be one of: debug info warn error
  -e LOG_LEVEL=info \
  -e PORT=8156 \
  # Uncomment and replace <token> if using ntfy notifications

## Example Configuration

The following is an example of a valid YAML configuration creating backups with restic every 3 am in the morning and cleaning the repo every Sunday at 5 am:

```yml
defaults:
  # every job will be appended to this cron and the jobs will run sequentially
  cron: '0 3 * * *'
  # global envs to use in all jobs
  envs:
    - key: RESTIC_PASSWORD_FILE
      value: '/secrets/.resticpwd'
    - key: BASE_REPOSITORY
      value: 'rclone:pcloud:Server/Backups'
    - key: APPDATA_PATH
      value: '/mnt/user/appdata'

jobs:
  - name: Cleanup
    # override the default cron
    cron: '0 5 * * 0'
    # envs just for the job, overwriting exiting defaults
    envs:
      - key: RESTIC_POLICY
        value: '--keep-daily 7 --keep-weekly 5 --keep-monthly 12 --keep-yearly 75'
      - key: RESTIC_POLICY_SHORT
        value: '--keep-last 7'
    commands:
      - command: restic -r ${BASE_REPOSITORY}/forgejo forget ${RESTIC_POLICY} --prune
      - command: restic -r ${BASE_REPOSITORY}/paperless forget ${RESTIC_POLICY} --prune
  - name: Forgejo
    envs:
      - key: RESTIC_REPOSITORY
        value: ${BASE_REPOSITORY}/forgejo
    commands:
      - command: docker exec -e PASSWORD=password forgejo-db pg_dump db --username=user
        file_output: ${APPDATA_PATH}/forgejo/.dbBackup.sql
      - command: restic backup ${APPDATA_PATH}/forgejo
  - name: Paperless
    envs:
      - key: RESTIC_REPOSITORY
        value: ${BASE_REPOSITORY}/paperless
    commands:
      - command: docker exec paperless document_exporter ${APPDATA_PATH}/paperless/export
        file_output: ${APPDATA_PATH}/paperless/.export.log
      - command: restic backup ${APPDATA_PATH}/paperless
  - name: Show files
    # only a command per job is required
    commands:
      - command: ls -la
```
